# Kids Weather Page

This repository contains a simple HTML page that shows the weather forecast. It uses the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API which does not require an API key.

## Features

- Search for a city by name
- Hourly temperature forecast for the current day
- 7 day temperature forecast
- Friendly advice on whether you can wear shorts today

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser. Enter a city name and click **Search**. The page will display hourly and daily temperatures using the Open-Meteo service.

Internet access is required to fetch weather data.

## Why not Google Weather?

Google does not provide an official public weather API. For that reason this project relies on the free Open-Meteo service instead.
